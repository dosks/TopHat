Top Hat README
=============

Top Hat is a tactical glide computer for the Android and Linux operating
systems.  Although it runs on all the platforms supported by XCSoar such as 
Window PC (Top Hat is a GUI that runs on the XCSoar platform), we're focusing 
our time on a GUI that runs on Android and Linux.

This file is aimed at developers.  We don't have a developer manual yet.  If you 
would like to write one that would be appreciated.  Our general approach to development
is to design before we code.  Designing can mean many things including creation of
mockup screens, interactive prototypes, and testing concepts directly with pilots. 


Getting the source
------------------

The Top Hat source code is managed with git (http://git-scm.com/).  It
can be downloaded with the following command:

 git clone git://github.com/rdunning0823/tophat
 
 Note: because Top Hat is currently rebased regurlarly off XCSoar, the 
 working branch of Top Hat is "TopHat_master" NOT "master".  Master is 
 the XCSoar code on which TopHat is based.

To update your repository, type:

 git pull

For more information, please refer to the git documentation.


Compiling from source
